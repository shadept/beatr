## Notes for Development Teams

### Architecture Considerations
This epic builds extensively on the existing Arc<Mutex<T>> architecture established in Epic 1. The settings system will integrate cleanly with the existing AudioEngine and UI patterns, while keyboard shortcuts will leverage egui's event handling system.

### Implementation Strategy
The sprint planning follows a logical progression: foundation first (settings), then workflow efficiency (keyboard), then polish (timeline UX). Each theme can be developed somewhat independently, but the dependencies listed must be respected.

### Testing Strategy
Each story includes comprehensive testing requirements, but integration testing across the epic will be critical. Pay special attention to:
- Settings persistence across application restarts
- Keyboard shortcut behavior in different UI contexts  
- Timeline performance with the full feature set enabled
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

### Success Metrics Tracking
Monitor the epic success metrics throughout implementation:
- Measure settings retention rates during development
- Time common task completion before and after keyboard shortcut implementation
- Gather user feedback on timeline interaction confidence and clarity

This epic represents a significant maturation of the Beatr application from a functional prototype to a polished, professional-grade tool suitable for serious music production workflows.
