# Story 1.8: Segment Visualization Enhancement

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** music producer using the drum sequencer's timeline,
**I want** timeline segments to display a visual preview of their contained patterns with improved text handling,
**so that** I can quickly identify the content and characteristics of each segment without needing to select them, while maintaining clean visual presentation that doesn't overflow or wrap.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Pattern Preview Visualization**: Each timeline segment displays a miniature visual representation of its pattern content
   - Given a timeline segment with drum patterns
   - When viewing the timeline
   - Then the segment shows a compact visual preview (mini-grid or pattern indicators) representing the active steps across all patterns
   - And the preview is visually distinct and readable at different zoom levels
   - And different drum patterns (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.) are distinguishable in the preview

2. **Intelligent Text Size and Content Reduction**: Segment text content is automatically sized and truncated to fit within segment boundaries
   - Given timeline segments of varying widths
   - When displaying segment information (name and loop count only)
   - Then text size scales appropriately based on available segment width
   - And text content is prioritized (name > loop count)
   - And BPM and time signature information is removed for cleaner presentation

3. **Text Overflow Prevention with Ellipses**: Text that would extend beyond segment boundaries is properly truncated
   - Given a segment with text content that exceeds the segment width
   - When rendering the segment
   - Then text is truncated with ellipses ("...") to indicate more content exists
   - And no text spills outside the segment boundaries
   - And truncation happens at appropriate word/character boundaries

4. **Zoom-Level Adaptive Display**: Pattern previews and text adapt their detail level based on timeline zoom
   - Given different timeline zoom levels (high zoom showing more detail, low zoom showing less)
   - When viewing segments at various zoom levels
   - Then pattern previews show appropriate detail for the zoom level
   - And text information is prioritized based on available space
   - And the visualization remains readable and useful across all zoom levels

5. **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced segment visualization maintains smooth timeline interaction
   - Given a timeline with multiple segments with pattern previews
   - When scrolling, zooming, or interacting with the timeline
   - Then performance remains smooth and responsive
   - And pattern preview rendering doesn't cause UI lag or stuttering
   - And memory usage remains reasonable with many segments

6. **Backward Compatibility**: Enhanced visualization works with existing timeline functionality
   - Given existing timeline features (segment selection, editing, playback)
   - When using the enhanced segment visualization
   - Then all existing timeline functionality continues to work without regression
   - And segment selection, editing, and playback are unaffected by the visual enhancements

## Dev Notes

### Current Timeline Segment Implementation Analysis
Based on `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs` analysis:

**Current Segment Drawing Logic** [Source: timeline_view.rs:371-424]:
- `draw_segment()` function handles segment visualization
- Current text display: segment name, loop count, active step count, time signature, and BPM
- Text positioning: centered in segment with secondary info below
- Basic overflow handling: some conditional display based on segment width (line 413)

**Key Integration Points** [Source: timeline_view.rs]:
- **Segment Rendering**: `draw_segment()` function at line 371 handles all segment visualization
- **Timeline Data Access**: Segments contain `patterns` field with full pattern data (line 400-402)
- **Current Text Logic**: Basic text display with some width-based conditional logic (lines 403-422)
- **Pattern Data Available**: Each segment contains `patterns` vector with `Step` data for preview generation

**Pattern Data Structure** [Source: audio/sequencer.rs and timeline/mod.rs]:
- Each `TimelineSegment` contains `patterns: Vec<Pattern>`
- Each `Pattern` contains `steps: Vec<Step>` with `active: bool` flag
- Current active step counting: `segment.patterns.iter().map(|p| p.steps.iter().filter(|s| s.active).count()).sum()`

### Architecture Alignment [Source: CLAUDE.md]
**Threading Model Compatibility**:
- Segment rendering happens on UI thread
- Pattern data accessed through `Arc<Mutex<Timeline>>` pattern
- Must maintain real-time safety - no allocations in audio callback
- UI updates trigger via `ctx.request_repaint()` for smooth visualization

**Pattern Grid Integration** [Source: pattern_grid.rs]:
- Current pattern visualization uses consistent color coding system
- Step buttons use time signature-aware grouping and coloring
- Pattern preview should maintain visual consistency with pattern grid
- Color system: active steps in green variants, beat boundaries emphasized

### Existing Visual System
**Current Segment Colors** [Source: timeline_view.rs:389-393]:
- Selected: RGB(100, 140, 220) fill, RGB(140, 180, 255) stroke
- Unselected: RGB(60, 80, 120) fill, RGB(100, 120, 160) stroke
- Pattern preview colors should complement this palette

**Text Rendering System** [Source: timeline_view.rs:404-421]:
- Uses `painter.text()` with CENTER_CENTER alignment
- Font size: 11.0 for main text
- Current text shows: `"{name} ({loop_count}x) [{active_steps}]"`
- **Enhancement**: Remove BPM and time signature text for cleaner presentation
- **Rationale**: BPM and time signature are available in timeline controls when segment is selected

### Technical Implementation Strategy
**Pattern Preview Rendering**:
1. Create mini-grid representation (8x1 or 4x1 dots/bars per pattern)
2. Use existing Step data to determine active/inactive visualization
3. Color-code by pattern type (kick=red, snare=blue, hi-hat=yellow, etc.)
4. Scale preview size based on available segment width

**Text Truncation Algorithm**:
1. Measure available width using egui text measurement
2. Prioritize content: name > loop count > active steps (pattern preview replaces active step count)
3. Progressive truncation: remove least important elements first (loop count if necessary)
4. Apply ellipses when truncating segment name if needed

**Zoom-Level Adaptation**:
- High zoom (>100px/s): Full pattern preview + name + loop count
- Medium zoom (50-100px/s): Simplified preview + name + loop count
- Low zoom (<50px/s): Minimal preview + name only

### Testing Requirements [Source: CLAUDE.md]
**Compile and Test Requirements**:
- Must compile native code and run tests after implementation
- No UI interaction testing possible - rely on comprehensive unit tests
- Test pattern preview generation logic independently
- Test text truncation algorithms with various content lengths
- Performance testing for rendering with multiple segments

**Test Coverage Areas**:
- Pattern preview generation with different pattern configurations
- Text truncation with various segment widths and content combinations
- Zoom-level adaptation logic
- Performance with 10+ segments containing pattern previews
- Integration with existing timeline functionality

### File Modification Requirements
**Primary Files to Modify**:
- `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs`: Enhance `draw_segment()` function
- Potentially add new utility functions for pattern preview generation
- May need helper functions for text measurement and truncation

**Files to Reference (No Changes)**:
- `src/ui/components/pattern_grid.rs`: For color scheme consistency
- `src/timeline/mod.rs`: For pattern data structure understanding
- `src/audio/sequencer.rs`: For Step and Pattern data structure reference

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
Based on existing testing patterns in `timeline_view.rs:799-1012`:
- **Pattern Preview Generation Tests**: Verify correct preview generation for various pattern configurations
- **Text Truncation Tests**: Test truncation logic with different content lengths and segment widths
- **Zoom-Level Adaptation Tests**: Verify appropriate detail levels at different zoom settings
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure rendering performance with multiple enhanced segments
- **Integration Tests**: Verify compatibility with existing timeline functionality

### Testing Framework [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Use existing Rust unit testing framework (`#[cfg(test)]` modules)
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Test individual components in isolation where possible
- Use mock data to test edge cases and various pattern configurations
