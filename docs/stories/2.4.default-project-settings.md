# Story 2.4: Default Project Settings

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** music producer,
**I want** to set default project parameters so that new projects start with my preferred BPM, time signature, and pattern length,
**so that** I can start creating music immediately without having to configure the same basic settings for every new project.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Default BPM Configuration** - User can set and persist default BPM for new projects
   - Given the user wants to configure default project settings
   - When the user accesses default settings in the Settings dialog
   - Then a BPM input field is available with range validation (60-300 BPM)
   - And the default BPM value is applied to new projects
   - And the default BPM setting is persisted across application sessions
   - And validation prevents invalid BPM values with appropriate error feedback

2. **Default Time Signature Configuration** - User can set and persist default time signature
   - Given the user wants to set a default time signature
   - When the user accesses time signature settings in the Defaults tab
   - Then numerator and denominator dropdowns are available
   - And numerator supports 1-16 values and denominator supports 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 values
   - And the default time signature is applied to new projects
   - And the time signature setting is validated and persisted across sessions
   - And common time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 2/4) are easily selectable

3. **Default Pattern Length Configuration** - User can set and persist default pattern length
   - Given the user wants to configure the default pattern length
   - When the user accesses pattern length settings in the Defaults tab
   - Then a pattern length input/slider is available with range 4-64 steps
   - And the default pattern length is applied to new pattern creation
   - And the pattern length setting is validated and persisted
   - And the setting provides immediate feedback on the selected length

4. **Auto-Save Settings Integration** - Default settings use existing auto-save infrastructure
   - Given the user has modified any default project settings
   - When the user changes default BPM, time signature, or pattern length
   - Then the changes are immediately validated and auto-saved
   - And invalid changes are prevented with user feedback
   - And the settings are applied immediately to the current session for new projects
   - And all settings persist correctly across application restarts

5. **Settings Dialog UI Integration** - Default settings integrated into existing settings UI
   - Given the user wants to access default project settings
   - When the user opens the Settings dialog
   - Then a "Defaults" tab is available alongside Audio and UI tabs
   - And all default settings are presented in a clear, organized layout
   - And the UI follows existing settings dialog patterns for consistency
   - And changes are applied immediately with the same UX as other settings tabs

- Cross-platform considerations important for default values

### Current Architecture Context [Source: src/settings.rs analysis]

**Existing DefaultSettings Structure** (lines 152-191):
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DefaultSettings {
    pub default_bpm: f32,
    pub default_time_signature: (u32, u32),
    pub default_pattern_length: usize,
}

impl Default for DefaultSettings {
    fn default() -> Self {
        DefaultSettings {
            default_bpm: 120.0,
            default_time_signature: (4, 4),
            default_pattern_length: 16,
        }
    }
}

impl DefaultSettings {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // BPM validation: 60.0 - 300.0
        // Time signature validation: numerator 1-16, denominator 1,2,4,8,16
        // Pattern length validation: 4-64 steps
    }
}
```

**Settings Integration** (lines 194-350):
- DefaultSettings is already integrated into AppSettings structure
- JSON serialization and persistence already working
- Auto-save functionality available via AppSettings::auto_save()
- Settings validation and sanitization patterns established

### Settings Dialog Current Implementation [Source: src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs]

**Current Tab Structure** (lines 24-29):
```rust
enum SettingsTab {
    Audio,
    UI,
    Defaults, // <- Already defined but not implemented
}
```

**Settings Dialog Architecture**:
- Tab-based organization with immediate apply functionality
- Audio tab: Device configuration, sample rate, buffer size, volume
- UI tab: Theme selection, UI scaling
- Defaults tab: **Not yet implemented** - this is what Story 2.4 will add
- Consistent styling patterns for input fields, dropdowns, and sliders

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**UI Controls Needed for Defaults Tab**:
- **BPM Input**: Numeric input field with validation range 60-300
- **Time Signature**: Two dropdowns (numerator: 1-16, denominator: 1,2,4,8,16)
- **Pattern Length**: Slider or input field with range 4-64 steps

**Validation Enhancement Needed**:
- DefaultSettings::validate() already exists with correct validation rules
- Need to add detailed error messages similar to UISettings validation
- Need to add sanitization method similar to UISettings::sanitize()
- Need to integrate with auto-save functionality

**Project Creation Integration Points**:
- New projects should use default_bpm from settings for initial BPM
- New projects should use default_time_signature for time signature setup
- New pattern creation should use default_pattern_length for initial pattern size

### File Locations for New Code [Source: project structure analysis]

**Primary Implementation Files**:
- **Settings Dialog Enhancement**: `src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs` - Add Defaults tab UI
- **Settings Enhancement**: `src/settings.rs` - Add sanitization and enhanced validation
- **Project Integration**: Review where project/pattern creation happens (likely `src/main.rs`, `src/ui/app.rs`)

**Integration Points**:
- Settings dialog tab switching (already established pattern)
- Auto-save integration (already working for other settings)
- Project creation logic (needs to be identified and modified)

### Validation and Error Handling [Source: existing validation patterns]

**Enhanced Validation Requirements**:
```rust
impl DefaultSettings {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Already exists, but needs enhanced error messages
        if self.default_bpm < 60.0 || self.default_bpm > 300.0 {
            return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Default BPM {} is invalid (must be 60-300)", self.default_bpm));
        }
        // Similar enhancements for time signature and pattern length
    }

    // New method needed
    pub fn sanitize(&mut self) -> Vec<String> {
        // Similar to UISettings::sanitize() pattern
        // Correct invalid values and return correction messages
    }
}
```

### Integration with Existing Patterns [Source: settings.rs lines 314-343]

**Auto-Save Integration**:
- Use existing AppSettings::auto_save() method
- Validation occurs before save (existing pattern)
- Sanitization can be integrated with existing sanitize_settings method
- User feedback patterns already established for corrections

**Settings Persistence**:
- JSON serialization already working for DefaultSettings
- Settings loading and saving already functional
- Cross-platform settings directory already established

### Testing Strategy [Source: existing test patterns in settings.rs]

**Existing Test Patterns to Follow**:
- Unit tests for validation with valid and invalid inputs
- Serialization/deserialization tests
- Settings sanitization tests with correction feedback
- Integration tests for settings persistence

**New Tests Required**:
- DefaultSettings enhanced validation tests
- DefaultSettings sanitization tests
- Settings dialog UI integration tests
- Project creation with custom defaults tests

### UI Layout and Styling Considerations

**Defaults Tab Layout** (following existing patterns):
```
┌─ Defaults Tab ─┐
│ Default BPM:   │  [120.0  ] (60-300)
│                │
│ Time Signature:│  [4 ▼] / [4 ▼]
│                │
│ Pattern Length:│  [======•====] 16 steps (4-64)
└────────────────┘
```

**Styling Consistency**:
- Follow existing tab styling from Audio and UI tabs
- Use consistent spacing, fonts, and control sizing
- Implement immediate validation feedback like other settings
- Use same color scheme and visual patterns
