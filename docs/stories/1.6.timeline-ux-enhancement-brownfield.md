# Story 1.6: Timeline UX Enhancement - Brownfield Addition

## Scrum Information
**Epic**: Timeline User Experience
**Sprint**: TBD  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: enhancement, ux, timeline, brownfield

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** music producer using the drum sequencer,  
**I want** a full-width timeline with horizontal scrolling and accurate time display,  
**so that** I can efficiently navigate through longer compositions and see precise timing information while maintaining smooth workflow.

## Story Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: `TimelineView` component (`/Users/shade/Projects/beatr/src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs`), `Timeline` struct (`/Users/shade/Projects/beatr/src/timeline/mod.rs`)
- Technology: Rust + egui UI framework with Arc<Mutex<T>> threading pattern
- Follows pattern: Existing timeline rendering with `draw_timeline()` and mouse interaction handling
- Touch points: Timeline visualization, scroll handling, time ruler display, segment interaction

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
**AC1**: **Full-Width Timeline**: Timeline spans entire available window width regardless of content length
- Given a timeline with any duration of content
- When the timeline view is rendered
- Then the timeline component uses 100% of available horizontal space

**AC2**: **Horizontal Scrolling**: Timeline supports smooth scrolling past both left and right boundaries with reasonable limits (e.g., -10% to +110% of total duration)
- Given a timeline with content spanning different durations
- When the user attempts to scroll horizontally
- Then the timeline smoothly scrolls with proper boundary limits
- And scrolling is prevented beyond reasonable limits

**AC3**: **Accurate Time Display**: Time ruler at top shows actual track timing that updates correctly during scroll and zoom operations
- Given any scroll position or zoom level
- When the timeline is displayed
- Then the time ruler shows accurate timing information
- And time marks align properly with timeline content

**AC4**: **Extensible Implementation**: Timeline view architecture supports future customizations (zoom persistence, scroll position memory, custom grid intervals)
- Given the new timeline implementation
- When future enhancements are needed
- Then the architecture accommodates extensions without major refactoring

### Integration Requirements
**AC5**: Existing timeline segment manipulation (drag, resize, snap) continues to work unchanged
- Given the enhanced timeline with scrolling
- When users perform existing segment operations
- Then all current drag, resize, and snap functionality works as before

**AC6**: New functionality follows existing egui interaction patterns and Arc<Mutex<T>> thread safety
- Given the enhanced timeline implementation
- When interacting with new scroll features
- Then the code follows established patterns and maintains thread safety

**AC7**: Integration with mouse interaction handling maintains current behavior for segment selection and playback seeking
- Given the scrollable timeline
- When users click or drag within the timeline
- Then segment selection and playback seeking work as expected

### Quality Requirements
**AC8**: Change is covered by unit tests extending existing timeline view test suite
- Given the enhanced timeline functionality
- When running tests
- Then new scroll and time display features have comprehensive test coverage

**AC9**: No regression in existing timeline functionality verified (zoom, segment operations, playback)
- Given the enhanced timeline
- When testing all existing features
- Then no existing functionality is broken or degraded

**AC10**: Performance impact is negligible for typical timeline sizes (100+ segments)
- Given a timeline with 100+ segments
- When using scroll and zoom functionality
- Then performance remains smooth and responsive

## Technical Requirements

### Current Implementation Analysis
Based on codebase analysis:
- TimelineView already has `scroll_position: f32` field (line 10)
- Timeline width currently calculated as `total_duration * zoom_level` (line 165)
- Time ruler implemented with dynamic mark intervals based on zoom (lines 219-263)
- Mouse interaction handles coordinate conversion via `(pos.x - rect.min.x) / zoom_level` (line 421)

### Implementation Approach
**Integration Approach:** Enhance existing `draw_timeline()` method in `TimelineView` to implement scrollable viewport with fixed ruler  
**Existing Pattern Reference:** Current timeline uses `egui::Rect` for content positioning - extend with `egui::ScrollArea` or custom scroll handling  
**Key Constraints:** Must maintain real-time audio thread safety, preserve existing zoom_level and segment interaction logic

### Technical Tasks
1. **Viewport Calculation**: Modify timeline rect calculation to support scrolling beyond content bounds
2. **Scroll Boundary Management**: Implement proper scroll limits (-10% to +110% of duration)
3. **Time Ruler Enhancement**: Ensure time ruler remains accurate during scroll operations
4. **Mouse Coordinate Translation**: Update mouse interaction to account for scroll offset
5. **Scroll State Persistence**: Maintain scroll position during timeline operations

## Business Value
- **User Experience**: Improved navigation for longer compositions enhances usability
- **Professional Workflow**: Supports more complex musical arrangements
- **Platform Readiness**: Prepares timeline for future advanced features
- **User Retention**: Better UX reduces friction in the composition workflow

## User Stories & Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Extended Composition Navigation**: Navigate through long song arrangements efficiently
2. **Precise Timeline Editing**: View and edit specific sections of longer compositions
3. **Time-Based Reference**: Rely on accurate timing display during editing
4. **Smooth Workflow**: Maintain flow while working with complex arrangements

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Timeline Exploration**: Browse timeline content beyond current viewport
2. **Segment Positioning**: Use full-width space for segment placement operations
3. **Timing Verification**: Verify exact timing of segments and transitions

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs`: Main timeline component requiring enhancement (lines 10, 147-217, 417-491)
- `src/timeline/mod.rs`: Timeline data structure (stable, no changes needed)
- `src/ui/app.rs`: Main application integration point
- Current zoom handling: Lines 36-42 in timeline_view.rs
- Current mouse interaction: Lines 417-491 in timeline_view.rs

### Current Implementation Details
- Timeline already has scroll_position field but uses fixed-width rendering
- Time ruler dynamically adjusts mark intervals based on zoom level
- Mouse interaction properly converts screen coordinates to timeline time
- Segment drawing includes visibility culling (lines 277-279)

### Integration Points
- **Existing Zoom System**: Maintain compatibility with current zoom controls
- **Segment Operations**: Preserve all drag-and-drop functionality
- **Audio Thread Safety**: Maintain Arc<Mutex<T>> pattern for timeline access
- **Performance**: Leverage existing visibility culling for segments

### Implementation Strategy
```rust
// Enhanced timeline drawing with scroll support
fn draw_timeline(&mut self, ui: &mut egui::Ui, rect: egui::Rect, _timeline: &Arc<Mutex<Timeline>>) {
    // Calculate scrollable content dimensions
    let total_duration = // ... get from timeline
    let content_width = total_duration * self.zoom_level;
    let view_width = rect.width();
    
    // Implement scroll boundaries (-10% to +110% of duration)
    let scroll_min = -0.1 * total_duration;
    let scroll_max = 1.1 * total_duration;
    
    // Create scrollable viewport
    let scroll_area = egui::ScrollArea::horizontal()
        .min_scrolled_width(view_width)
        .max_width(f32::INFINITY);
        
    // Handle time ruler with scroll offset
    self.draw_time_ruler_with_scroll(&painter, rect, scroll_offset);
    
    // Update mouse coordinate translation
    let timeline_time = ((pos.x - rect.min.x + scroll_offset) / self.zoom_level) as f64;
}
```

### Risk Mitigation
**Primary Risk:** Scroll position calculations could interfere with existing segment mouse interaction  
**Mitigation:** Maintain separate coordinate systems for scroll viewport vs. timeline content  
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to current fixed-width timeline by removing scroll handling

## Dependencies
- **Story 1.4**: Timeline composition - provides the base timeline implementation
- **Current egui Framework**: Requires compatible egui ScrollArea or custom scroll implementation
- **Existing Audio System**: No changes needed, maintains current thread safety

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Timeline spans full available width with proper scroll boundaries
- [ ] Time ruler displays accurate timing information during all scroll/zoom operations  
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling works smoothly with appropriate limits
- [ ] Architecture supports future timeline customizations
- [ ] All existing timeline functionality regression tested
- [ ] Unit tests cover new scrolling and time display behavior
- [ ] Code follows existing Rust/egui patterns and thread safety requirements
