# Story 1.7: Time Signature Restoration and Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** music producer and composer using the drum sequencer,
**I want** fully functional time signature controls with per-segment support and enhanced drumming pattern capabilities,
**so that** I can create complex compositions with various time signatures and time signature changes throughout my tracks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Global Time Signature Control Restoration**: Time signature controls are visible and functional in the main UI alongside tempo controls
   - Given the main application interface
   - When I look at the transport controls
   - Then I see time signature preset buttons (4/4, 3/4, 5/4, 6/8, 7/8, 9/8, 12/8) and custom input fields
   - And the controls display the current time signature and respond to changes

2. **Per-Segment Time Signature Support**: Each timeline segment can have its own time signature that affects pattern playback and visualization
   - Given a timeline with multiple segments
   - When I select a segment and change its time signature
   - Then only that segment uses the new time signature for playback and visual grouping
   - And other segments maintain their individual time signatures

3. **Enhanced Pattern Grid Visualization**: Pattern grids adapt to time signature with proper beat groupings and visual indicators
   - Given a pattern with a specific time signature (e.g., 3/4, 7/8)
   - When the pattern is displayed
   - Then steps are visually grouped by beats with appropriate separators
   - And strong beats (downbeats) are visually emphasized
   - And step numbering follows musical convention (beat.subdivision format)

4. **Time Signature Change Workflow**: Changing time signatures provides intuitive feedback and suggested optimizations
   - Given any current time signature setting
   - When I change to a new time signature
   - Then the system suggests optimal loop lengths for musical alignment
   - And pattern visualization immediately updates to reflect the new grouping
   - And audio playback aligns with the new time signature

5. **Complex Drumming Pattern Support**: Support for advanced drumming patterns including polyrhythms and odd meters
   - Given various time signatures (including complex ones like 7/8, 11/8, 5/4)
   - When creating drum patterns
   - Then all time signatures work correctly with pattern creation and playback
   - And the system handles transitions between different time signatures smoothly

6. **Compatibility with Existing Features**: Time signature functionality integrates seamlessly with all existing timeline and sequencer features
   - Given the restored time signature functionality
   - When using existing features (timeline editing, segment manipulation, loop lengths, tempo changes)
   - Then all existing functionality continues to work without regression
   - And time signature changes interact properly with variable loop lengths and timeline segments

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis
Based on codebase analysis, the time signature functionality is **fully implemented but not displayed in the UI**:

- **TimeSignatureControl exists**: `src/ui/components/time_signature_control.rs` - complete implementation with presets and custom input
- **TimeSignature struct functional**: `src/audio/sequencer.rs` - full implementation with validation and preset methods
- **Per-segment support exists**: `src/timeline/mod.rs` - TimelineSegment has time_signature field and setter methods
- **UI integration missing**: `src/ui/app.rs` imports the control but never calls `TimeSignatureControl::show()`

### Key Integration Points
- **Main UI Integration**: Line 2 of `src/ui/app.rs` imports TimeSignatureControl but it's never used
- **State Management**: Lines 16-17 and 33-34 show custom_time_sig_numerator/denominator fields already exist
- **Timeline Integration**: `src/timeline/mod.rs` lines 6-7 show per-segment time signature support exists
- **Pattern Grid**: `src/ui/components/pattern_grid.rs` needs enhancement for time signature-aware visualization

### Existing Code Structure
From `src/ui/components/time_signature_control.rs`:
```rust
pub fn show(ui: &mut egui::Ui, sequencer: &Arc<Mutex<Sequencer>>,
           custom_numerator: &mut String, custom_denominator: &mut String) -> bool
```

From `src/timeline/mod.rs`:
```rust
pub struct TimelineSegment {
    // ... other fields
    pub time_signature: TimeSignature,
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **UI Restoration**: Add TimeSignatureControl::show() call in app.rs update method near TempoControl::show()
2. **Segment UI**: Extend timeline_view.rs to show time signature controls for selected segments
3. **Pattern Visualization**: Update pattern_grid.rs to use time signature for visual grouping
4. **Integration**: Ensure all components work together with existing Arc<Mutex<T>> threading pattern

### Previous Story Context
- **Story 1.3** (time-signature-visualization) was marked "Approved" but implementation was incomplete
- **Story 1.6** (timeline-ux-enhancement) may have inadvertently removed time signature UI elements
- **Story 1.4** (timeline-composition) provides the foundation for per-segment time signature support

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing codebase patterns:
- Unit tests should follow existing test patterns in sequencer.rs and timeline/mod.rs
- Integration tests should verify UI interactions with audio thread safety (Arc<Mutex<T>>)
- UI tests should verify visual grouping and user interaction workflows
- Regression tests must ensure no interference with existing timeline functionality

### Architecture Compatibility Notes [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Must maintain Arc<Mutex<T>> pattern for thread-safe communication between audio and UI threads
- Audio processing must remain real-time safe (no allocations in audio callback)
- UI updates trigger via ctx.request_repaint() for smooth real-time visualization
- Pattern state changes go through mutex-protected sequencer methods
