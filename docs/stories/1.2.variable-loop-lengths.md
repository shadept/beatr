# Story 1.2: variable-loop-lengths

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** composer and beat maker,
**I want** to choose different loop subdivision lengths (4, 8, 16, 32 steps) and odd time signatures,
**so that** I can create more complex and varied musical patterns beyond traditional 16-step loops

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can select from predefined loop lengths: 4, 8, 16, 32 steps
2. The pattern grid UI dynamically adjusts to show the selected number of steps
3. Loop length selection is accessible via a dedicated control in the transport panel
4. All existing patterns adapt to the new loop length (truncate if shorter, extend with empty steps if longer)
5. Playback timing and BPM calculations work correctly for all supported loop lengths
6. Step position indicators and visual groupings adjust appropriately for each loop length
7. Pattern data persists correctly when switching between different loop lengths
8. Advanced users can input custom loop lengths for odd time signatures (e.g., 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 steps)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/audio/sequencer.rs`: Contains Pattern struct and Sequencer with hardcoded 16-step logic in advance_step() and initialize_default_patterns()
- `src/ui/components/pattern_grid.rs`: Renders step buttons with hardcoded 16-step loops and visual grouping logic
- `src/ui/app.rs`: Transport panel where loop length controls should be added alongside existing tempo controls
- `src/ui/components/mod.rs`: Will need new LoopLengthControl component export

### Current Implementation Constraints
- Pattern struct currently has fixed Vec<Step> with 16 elements
- Sequencer.advance_step() uses hardcoded modulo 16 operation: `(self.current_step + 1) % 16`
- PatternGrid.show() iterates 0..16 for step headers and pattern_steps.iter().enumerate()
- Visual grouping assumes 4-beat measures with separators every 4 steps
- All timing calculations assume 16th note subdivisions

### Key Architecture Patterns to Maintain
- Arc<Mutex<T>> pattern for thread-safe access between UI and audio threads
- egui immediate mode UI with consistent sizing (STEP_BUTTON_WIDTH: 32.0)
- Pattern grid uses fixed column widths for alignment
- Real-time audio callback must remain allocation-free

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Data Structure Changes**: Pattern.steps must become dynamic length, Pattern needs length field
2. **UI Adaptation**: PatternGrid must handle variable step counts with horizontal scrolling for 32+ steps
3. **Timing Synchronization**: Sequencer timing must adapt per-pattern, not globally
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Default to 16 steps to maintain existing pattern behavior

### Critical Dependencies from Story 1.1
- PatternGrid now has 8 patterns (3 original + 5 new samples) that all need length adaptation
- Fixed column alignment system must be preserved when adding step count flexibility
- Testing framework established in samples.rs and sequencer.rs should be extended

### Integration Points
- Transport panel layout established in app.rs needs loop length control integration
- Pattern initialization in initialize_default_patterns() needs length parameter
- Audio processing pipeline in process_audio() must handle variable timing

### Testing

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests for Pattern struct with variable lengths (resize operations, boundary conditions)
- Integration tests for Sequencer with different loop lengths (4, 8, 16, 32 steps)
- UI tests for PatternGrid rendering at different step counts
- Timing accuracy tests for BPM calculations with variable lengths
- Edge case tests for custom loop lengths (1, 3, 5, 7, 64 steps)

### Test Locations
- Pattern tests: extend existing tests in `src/audio/sequencer.rs`
- Sequencer timing tests: new test module in `src/audio/sequencer.rs`
- UI component tests: unit tests for LoopLengthControl component

### Specific Test Scenarios
- Pattern resize: 16→8 (truncation), 8→16 (extension with empty steps)
- Timing validation: verify step advancement for each supported length
- UI responsiveness: pattern grid rendering performance with 32+ steps
- Data persistence: save/load patterns with custom lengths

### Completion Notes List
✅ **Core Architecture**: Added `loop_length` field to Sequencer with default 16 for backward compatibility
