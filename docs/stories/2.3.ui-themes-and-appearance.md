# Story 2.3: UI Themes & Appearance

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user of the Beatr drum sequencer,
**I want** to customize the application appearance and scaling with dark/light/auto themes and UI scaling options,
**so that** the interface is comfortable for my screen and lighting conditions and provides optimal visibility and usability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Theme Selection with Auto-Detection** - Support for Dark, Light, and Auto theme modes with system integration
   - Given the user wants to customize the application's visual appearance
   - When the user accesses theme settings in the Settings dialog
   - Then Dark, Light, and Auto theme options are available in a dropdown selection
   - And Auto theme automatically follows the system's dark/light mode preference
   - And the selected theme is applied immediately without requiring application restart
   - And the theme selection is persisted across application sessions

2. **Comprehensive Theme Implementation** - Complete visual theming affecting all UI components
   - Given the user has selected a theme (Dark/Light/Auto)
   - When the theme is applied to the application
   - Then all UI components reflect the chosen theme consistently including main window, settings dialog, timeline view, pattern grid, and transport controls
   - And color schemes provide appropriate contrast and readability for each theme
   - And theme changes are applied smoothly without visual glitches
   - And egui's built-in theme system is leveraged for consistent styling

3. **UI Scaling Configuration** - Configurable UI scale factor with live preview and system integration
   - Given the user wants to adjust the interface size for their display
   - When the user accesses UI scale settings in the Settings dialog
   - Then a scale slider/input is available with range 0.5x to 3.0x in 0.1x increments
   - And scale changes are applied immediately with live preview
   - And the scale setting affects all UI elements proportionally (text, buttons, spacing, icons)
   - And the scale preference is saved and restored across sessions

4. **System Theme Integration** - Auto theme responds to system theme changes dynamically
   - Given the user has selected "Auto" theme mode
   - When the system's dark/light mode preference changes
   - Then the application automatically switches to match the system theme
   - And the theme change happens without user intervention
   - And the user receives subtle feedback about the automatic theme change
   - And the Auto setting continues to track system changes during application runtime

5. **Theme and Scale Validation** - Robust validation and fallback handling for theme and scale settings
   - Given potentially invalid theme or scale settings from saved configuration
   - When the application loads settings or user modifies values
   - Then invalid theme names fall back to "dark" default
   - And invalid scale values are constrained to 0.5x-3.0x range with fallback to 1.0x
   - And validation errors are handled gracefully without application crashes
   - And users receive feedback about any corrected invalid values

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights [Source: Story 2.1 and 2.2 Dev Agent Records]

**Key learnings from Settings Infrastructure (Story 2.1)**:
- AppSettings structure with UISettings already exists and includes `theme` and `ui_scale` fields
- Settings persistence via JSON works correctly with auto-save functionality
- Settings dialog provides immediate apply functionality with tabbed interface
- Validation patterns established for settings with graceful fallback to defaults
- Settings dialog located at `src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs` with UI tab functional

**Key learnings from Audio Device Configuration (Story 2.2)**:
- Immediate apply functionality works well for settings changes
- Device status indicators and user feedback patterns established
- Settings validation and testing patterns proven effective
- Cross-platform compilation considerations (#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]) important

### Current Architecture Context [Source: src/settings.rs analysis]

**Existing UISettings Structure**:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct UISettings {
    pub theme: String,     // Currently supports "dark", "light"
    pub ui_scale: f32,     // Range 0.5 to 3.0
}

impl UISettings {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Currently validates only "dark" and "light" themes
        // Scale validation: 0.5 to 3.0 range
    }
}
```

**Settings Dialog Current Implementation** [Source: src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs]:
- Theme dropdown currently supports "dark" and "light" options only
- UI scale slider implements 0.5x to 3.0x range with immediate apply
- Tab-based organization with UI settings in dedicated tab
- Immediate apply functionality working for theme and scale changes

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Theme System Enhancement**:
- Add "auto" as valid theme option in UISettings::validate()
- Implement system theme detection using platform-appropriate method
- Create theme resolution function: auto -> system dark/light detection -> egui theme
- Monitor system theme changes during runtime for auto mode

**System Theme Detection Implementation**:
```rust
// Recommended approach using dark-light crate
fn detect_system_theme() -> String {
    match dark_light::detect() {
        dark_light::Mode::Dark => "dark".to_string(),
        dark_light::Mode::Light => "light".to_string(),
        dark_light::Mode::Default => "dark".to_string(), // fallback
    }
}

// Enhanced theme resolution
fn resolve_theme(ui_theme: &str) -> String {
    match ui_theme {
        "auto" => detect_system_theme(),
        "dark" | "light" => ui_theme.to_string(),
        _ => "dark".to_string(), // fallback for invalid themes
    }
}
```

**egui Theme Integration** [Source: egui documentation patterns]:
- Use egui::Context::set_visuals() to apply dark/light themes
- Create consistent Visuals configurations for each theme
- Apply theme changes immediately without requiring restart
- Ensure theme affects all UI components including custom ones

**Scale Application Enhancement**:
- Current scale slider functional but may need refinement for 0.1x increments
- Use egui::Context::set_pixels_per_point() for immediate scale application
- Test scale at extreme values for usability and visual consistency

### File Locations for New Code [Source: project structure analysis]

**Primary Implementation Files**:
- **Settings Enhancement**: `src/settings.rs` - Add "auto" theme validation, enhance scale validation
- **Settings Dialog Update**: `src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs` - Add auto theme option, enhance scale controls
- **App Integration**: `src/ui/app.rs` - Theme resolution and system monitoring integration

**New Dependencies** (likely needed):
- `dark-light` crate for system theme detection (cross-platform)
- Possible platform-specific dependencies for theme monitoring

### Cross-Platform Considerations [Source: existing WASM patterns]

**WebAssembly Compatibility**:
- System theme detection may have limited support in WASM builds
- Use `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` for web-specific theme behavior
- Fallback to manual theme selection if system detection unavailable
- Consider browser dark mode detection via web APIs for WASM builds

**Platform-Specific Theme Detection**:
- macOS: Use NSUserDefaults or dark-light crate
- Windows: Registry settings or dark-light crate
- Linux: gsettings or dark-light crate
- WASM: Browser-based detection or manual fallback

### Integration with egui Framework [Source: egui patterns in existing code]

**egui Visuals Integration**:
- Use egui::Visuals::dark() and egui::Visuals::light() as base configurations
- Customize colors for application-specific components (timeline, pattern grid)
- Apply via ctx.set_visuals() in main update loop
- Handle theme transitions smoothly to avoid visual glitches

**Scale Factor Application**:
- egui supports pixels_per_point for overall scaling
- Current settings dialog implementation should already handle this
- Ensure scale affects all custom UI components proportionally

### Theme Change Monitoring Strategy

**Runtime Theme Monitoring**:
- Implement periodic system theme checking (every few seconds)
- Use callback-based approach if platform supports it
- Cache previous theme state to detect changes
- Apply changes immediately when detected

**User Feedback for Auto Theme Changes**:
- Subtle notification when auto theme switches (toast message or status indicator)
- Avoid disruptive notifications but provide awareness of automatic changes

### Testing Strategy [Source: existing test patterns in settings.rs]

**Unit Tests Required**:
- Theme validation with new "auto" option
- Theme resolution logic (auto -> dark/light)
- Scale validation edge cases and constraint handling
- System theme detection functionality
- Invalid settings fallback behavior

**Integration Tests**:
- Theme application across all UI components
- Scale factor application and visual consistency
- Settings persistence with new theme options
- System theme change detection and response
- Theme and scale combination testing

### Performance and UX Considerations

**Theme Application Performance**:
- Theme changes should be immediate with no noticeable delay
- Avoid rebuilding entire UI on theme change - use egui's built-in mechanisms
- Cache theme-related computations where possible

**Scale Application UX**:
- Live preview during scale adjustment (already implemented)
- Reasonable scale increments (0.1x) for fine control
- Visual consistency at all scale levels

## QA Results

### QA Review - Light Theme Implementation Issues
**Reviewer:** Quinn (QA Agent)
**Date:** 2025-08-06
**Status:** ❌ INCOMPLETE - Light theme partially implemented but significant gaps remain

### Issues Identified

**Critical Light Theme Gaps:**
1. **Top Bar (Menu Bar)** - Uses hardcoded dark gray background (`Color32::from_gray(20)`) at `src/ui/app.rs:417`
2. **Transport Controls Bar** - Multiple hardcoded dark values:
   - Container: `Color32::from_gray(30)` and border `Color32::from_gray(50)` at `src/ui/app.rs:465-466`
3. **Timeline Section** - Extensive hardcoded dark theme colors:
   - Background: `Color32::from_gray(25)` at `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs:267`
   - Border: `Color32::from_gray(60)` at `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs:268`
   - Ruler: `Color32::from_gray(35)` at `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs:334`
   - Selected segments: `Color32::from_rgb(100, 140, 220)` at `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs:535`
   - Grid lines: `Color32::from_gray(45)` and `Color32::from_gray(65)` at `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs:657,671,680`
4. **Pattern Grid** - Multiple hardcoded dark colors:
   - Background: `Color32::from_gray(25)` at `src/ui/components/pattern_grid.rs:76`
   - Border: `Color32::from_gray(50)` at `src/ui/components/pattern_grid.rs:77`
   - Step buttons: Various grays (40-60) that don't adapt at `src/ui/components/pattern_grid.rs:210-214`

**Correctly Implemented Light Theme Elements:**
- ✅ Play button and transport controls (using egui built-in button styling)
- ✅ BPM widget (using egui built-in styling)
- ✅ Settings dialog (uses egui theme system)

### Root Cause Analysis
The implementation successfully applies `egui::Visuals::light()` vs `egui::Visuals::dark()` at `src/ui/app.rs:338-342`, but **many custom UI components bypass this system** by using hardcoded `Color32` values instead of theme-aware colors from `ui.visuals()`.

### Recommended Fixes
1. **Replace hardcoded Color32 with theme-aware colors:**
   ```rust
   // Instead of: egui::Color32::from_gray(25)
   // Use: ui.visuals().extreme_bg_color or ui.visuals().panel_fill

   // Instead of: egui::Color32::from_gray(60)
   // Use: ui.visuals().window_stroke.color
   ```

2. **Create theme helper functions for consistent color mapping:**
   ```rust
   fn get_container_bg_color(visuals: &egui::Visuals) -> egui::Color32 {
       if visuals.dark_mode {
           egui::Color32::from_gray(30)
       } else {
           egui::Color32::from_gray(245) // Light equivalent
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Priority fix order:** Top bar → Transport bar → Timeline section → Pattern grid

### Test Results
- ✅ Theme switching mechanism works
- ✅ Settings persistence works
- ✅ Auto theme detection works
- ❌ Light theme visual consistency incomplete
- ❌ Key UI sections remain dark in light mode

**Overall Assessment:** While the theme infrastructure is solid, the light theme user experience is significantly degraded due to these visual inconsistencies. This affects usability in bright environments where light themes are most needed.
