# Story 1.4: timeline-composition

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** songwriter and composer,
**I want** to arrange multiple drum loops along a timeline to create complete songs with verses, choruses, and variations,
**so that** I can compose full-length drum tracks with dynamic arrangements rather than being limited to single repeating loops

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create a song timeline that displays multiple loops arranged horizontally
2. Loops can be added, duplicated, moved, and deleted along the timeline
3. Each timeline position can contain a different drum pattern with its own time signature and loop length
4. Playback follows the timeline sequence, transitioning smoothly between different loops
5. Users can extend loops across multiple timeline segments for longer sections (e.g., 8-bar verses)
6. Timeline supports splitting longer loops into smaller segments for detailed editing
7. Visual timeline shows loop boundaries, patterns, and timing information
8. Users can copy patterns between timeline segments and modify them independently
9. Timeline playback includes position indicator and basic transport controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
10. Export functionality captures the entire timeline composition as a single audio file

## Business Value
- **Song Creation**: Enables full song composition beyond single patterns
- **Creative Workflow**: Professional arrangement capabilities for complete tracks
- **User Retention**: Advanced features keep users engaged for longer sessions
- **Market Position**: Positions Beatr as a serious composition tool, not just a loop machine

## User Stories & Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Song Structure Creation**: Compose verse-chorus-bridge-chorus song structures
2. **Dynamic Arrangements**: Create builds, breakdowns, and variations throughout a song
3. **Extended Sections**: Use identical patterns for longer sections (8-bar choruses, 16-bar verses)
4. **Detailed Editing**: Split extended sections to add fills, variations, and flourishes
5. **Pattern Evolution**: Start with a basic pattern and evolve it across the song timeline

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Live Performance**: Pre-arranged song structures for live drumming backing tracks
2. **Collaboration**: Share complete song arrangements with other musicians
3. **Demo Creation**: Quick song demos with complete drum arrangements
4. **Template Building**: Create song templates for different musical styles

## Technical Requirements

### Timeline Data Structure
```rust
pub struct Timeline {
    segments: Vec<TimelineSegment>,
    current_position: f64,  // In seconds
    total_duration: f64,
    playback_state: PlaybackState,
}

pub struct TimelineSegment {
    id: String,
    start_time: f64,     // Seconds from timeline start
    duration: f64,       // Segment duration in seconds
    pattern_id: String,  // Reference to pattern
    loop_count: usize,   // How many times to repeat this pattern
    time_signature: TimeSignature,
    bpm: f32,
}

pub enum PlaybackState {
    Stopped,
    Playing,
    Paused,
}
```

### Timeline Operations
- **Add Segment**: Insert new pattern at timeline position
- **Duplicate Segment**: Copy existing segment to new position
- **Move Segment**: Drag and drop timeline repositioning
- **Delete Segment**: Remove segment and adjust timeline
- **Split Segment**: Divide longer segments into smaller parts
- **Extend Segment**: Increase loop count for longer sections
- **Pattern Assignment**: Link segments to specific drum patterns

### Playback System
- **Sequential Playback**: Follow timeline from start to end
- **Position Tracking**: Real-time playback position indicator
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless pattern changes at segment boundaries
- **Transport Controls**: Play, pause, stop, seek to position
- **Loop Integration**: Each segment respects its pattern's loop length and time signature

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/audio/sequencer.rs`: Current single-loop playback system needs timeline integration
- `src/ui/app.rs`: Main interface needs timeline view integration
- `src/audio/engine.rs`: Audio processing needs timeline-aware playback
- New: `src/timeline/` module for timeline-specific logic
- New: `src/ui/components/timeline_view.rs` for timeline UI

### Current Limitations to Overcome
- **Single Pattern Focus**: Current system only plays one pattern at a time
- **No Song Structure**: No concept of arrangement or song progression
- **Limited Playback**: Playback is infinite loop, not sequential progression
- **No Position Tracking**: No timeline position or seeking capabilities

### Integration Points
- **Pattern System**: Timeline segments reference existing drum patterns
- **Time Signatures**: Each segment can have different time signatures (Story 1.3)
- **Loop Lengths**: Segment duration based on pattern loop length Ã— repeat count
- **Audio Engine**: Timeline controls overall playback flow
- **Transport Controls**: Enhanced with timeline navigation

### Timeline Playback Logic
```rust
impl Timeline {
    fn update_playback(&mut self, delta_time: f64, sequencer: &mut Sequencer) {
        if self.playback_state != PlaybackState::Playing { return; }

        self.current_position += delta_time;

        // Find current segment
        if let Some(segment) = self.get_current_segment() {
            // Update sequencer to play current segment's pattern
            sequencer.set_pattern(segment.pattern_id);
            sequencer.set_time_signature(segment.time_signature);

            // Check if segment is complete
            if self.current_position >= segment.end_time() {
                self.advance_to_next_segment();
            }
        } else {
            // Timeline complete
            self.stop_playback();
        }
    }
}
```

### UI Design Considerations
- **Horizontal Layout**: Timeline extends horizontally with scroll support
- **Segment Visualization**: Clear boundaries, pattern names, loop counts
- **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive segment manipulation
- **Zoom Controls**: Different timeline zoom levels (measures, seconds, minutes)
- **Multi-track Preparation**: Design scalable for future multi-track support
- **Playback Feedback**: Clear position indicator and progress visualization

### Data Persistence
- **Timeline Storage**: Save/load complete timeline arrangements
- **Pattern References**: Timeline segments reference patterns by ID
- **Version Control**: Track timeline changes for undo/redo
- **Export Metadata**: Store timeline information with exported audio

## Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: Additional drum samples - provides variety for different segments
- **Story 1.2**: Variable loop lengths - enables different segment durations
- **Story 1.3**: Time signature visualization - supports different time signatures per segment
- **Current Audio System**: Foundation for timeline-aware playback

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can create multi-segment song timelines
- [ ] Drag-and-drop timeline editing fully functional
- [ ] Sequential playback through timeline segments works correctly
- [ ] Segment splitting and extension features operational
- [ ] Pattern copying and independent editing supported
- [ ] Export captures entire timeline composition

- Swing and groove variations per segment
- Visual waveform display in timeline
- MIDI export of timeline arrangements
- Collaborative timeline editing
