# Story 1.10: Audio Engine Buffer Clearing

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** music producer using the drum sequencer,
**I want** the audio engine to properly clear its internal buffer state when playback stops and starts,
**so that** when I stop and restart playback, I don't hear remnants of previous sounds and new sounds aren't delayed by leftover processing state.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Clean Audio State on Stop**:
   - Given the timeline is playing audio
   - When I stop playback through the UI
   - Then all internal audio buffers and voice states are immediately cleared
   - And no remnants of previous audio remain in the processing pipeline

2. **Fresh Start on Play**:
   - Given I previously stopped audio playback
   - When I start playback again through the UI
   - Then audio processing begins with completely clean state
   - And there are no delays or artifacts from previous playback sessions

3. **Voice State Reset**:
   - Given multiple voices were playing samples during previous playback
   - When playback is stopped and restarted
   - Then all voice positions and active states are reset to initial values
   - And sample playback starts from the beginning without position carryover

4. **Timeline Position Synchronization**:
   - Given the timeline position changes (seek, stop, restart)
   - When audio processing resumes
   - Then audio state is synchronized with the current timeline position
   - And step counters and sample positions align with timeline state

## Dev Notes

### Current Audio Architecture Context [Source: CLAUDE.md]
**Audio Threading Model**:
- Main Thread: UI rendering and user interaction via egui
- Audio Thread: Real-time audio processing via CPAL callback
- Synchronization: `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared state (sequencer patterns, sample bank)
- Audio processing must remain real-time safe (no allocations in audio callback)

**Key Audio Components**:
- **AudioEngine** (`src/audio/engine.rs`): Initializes CPAL audio stream, owns sequencer and sample bank via `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
- **Timeline** (`src/timeline/mod.rs`): Manages playback state, position tracking, and segment coordination
- **Audio Callback** (`src/audio/engine.rs:249-289`): Real-time audio processing with timeline integration

### Current Audio State Issues (User-Reported)
**Static Audio State Persistence** [Source: src/audio/engine.rs:246]:
- `static mut AUDIO_STATE: Option<AudioState>` persists across play/stop cycles
- Audio state is initialized once via `std::sync::Once` and never reset
- Voice positions and step counters maintain values from previous playback sessions
- No mechanism to clear or reset audio processing state

**Voice State Retention** [Source: src/audio/engine.rs:110-116]:
- `AudioState.voices: Vec<Voice>` contains 16 voice instances for sample playback
- Voice positions (`sample_position`) continue from previous playback when stopped mid-sample
- Active voice flags remain set across timeline stop/start cycles
- No voice state clearing when timeline playback ends

**Timeline State Integration** [Source: src/audio/engine.rs:264-288]:
- Audio callback checks `timeline.is_playing()` but doesn't detect state transitions
- No synchronization between timeline position changes and audio processing state
- Step counters (`current_step`, `sample_counter`) don't reset on timeline position changes
- Audio processing continues with stale timing when timeline seeks or restarts

### Audio State Structure [Source: src/audio/engine.rs:110-136]
**AudioState Components**:
- `current_step: usize` - Current step in pattern sequence (0-15)
- `samples_per_step: usize` - Timing calculation for step advancement
- `sample_counter: usize` - Sample count within current step
- `voices: Vec<Voice>` - 16 voice instances for polyphonic sample playback
- `loop_length: usize` - Pattern loop length (typically 16)

**Voice Components** [Source: src/audio/engine.rs:198-204]:
- `sample_position: usize` - Current position within sample data
- `sample_name: String` - Name of currently playing sample
- `velocity: f32` - Playback velocity/volume
- `active: bool` - Whether voice is currently playing

### Timeline Playback Control [Source: src/timeline/mod.rs:207-218]
**Playback States**:
- `PlaybackState::Stopped` - Timeline stopped, position reset to 0.0
- `PlaybackState::Playing` - Timeline actively playing, position advancing
- `PlaybackState::Paused` - Timeline paused, position maintained

**State Transition Methods**:
- `timeline.play()` - Sets state to Playing
- `timeline.pause()` - Sets state to Paused
- `timeline.stop()` - Sets state to Stopped, resets position to 0.0
- `timeline.seek(position)` - Changes current position

### File Locations for Modifications
**Primary Files to Modify**:
- `src/audio/engine.rs` - Audio callback and AudioState management (lines 109-289)
- `src/timeline/mod.rs` - Timeline state management integration (lines 207-254)

**Files to Reference (No Changes)**:
- `src/ui/app.rs` - UI timeline control integration
- `src/ui/components/transport_controls.rs` - Transport control UI components

### Testing

#### Unit Tests Required
**Audio State Reset Testing**:
- Test AudioState.reset() method clears all voice states and counters
- Verify voice positions reset to 0 and active flags set to false
- Test step counters and sample counters reset to initial values
- Validate timing recalculation on audio state reset

**Timeline Integration Testing**:
- Test audio state synchronization on timeline.play() calls
- Verify audio state clearing on timeline.stop() calls
- Test audio state updates on timeline.seek() position changes
- Validate no audio artifacts persist across stop/start cycles

**Voice State Management Testing**:
- Test voice state clearing when timeline stops mid-sample
- Verify voice state initialization on fresh timeline start
- Test multiple voice cleanup during rapid stop/start cycles
- Validate voice state isolation between different timeline instances

#### Integration Testing
**Playback Cycle Testing**:
- Test complete stop → start → stop cycles produce clean audio
- Verify no audio delays or artifacts during playback transitions
- Test rapid stop/start cycles don't cause audio glitches
- Validate timeline seeking immediately synchronizes audio processing

### Testing Framework [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Use existing Rust unit testing framework (`#[cfg(test)]` modules)
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Test individual audio components in isolation where possible
- Audio tests should focus on state management and transition behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Audio state reset must be real-time safe (no allocations in audio callback)
- Timeline state checking should have minimal overhead in audio processing
- Voice state clearing should be efficient for 16 voice instances
- State synchronization must not introduce audio dropouts or glitches
