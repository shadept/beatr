# Story 2.2: Audio Device Configuration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** music producer using Beatr,
**I want** to configure my audio devices and settings with live device enumeration and monitoring,
**so that** I can optimize audio performance for my specific hardware setup and respond to device changes during my production sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Real-time Audio Device Enumeration** - Detect and list all available audio output devices with live refresh capability
   - Given the user opens the audio settings section
   - When the settings dialog loads
   - Then all currently available audio output devices are listed in a dropdown
   - And the list includes device names and shows which device is currently selected
   - And a "Refresh Devices" button allows real-time re-enumeration of available devices
   - And the default device is clearly identified in the list

2. **Device Configuration with Immediate Feedback** - Apply device selection with validation and user feedback
   - Given the user selects a different audio device from the dropdown
   - When the selection is changed
   - Then the new device is immediately tested for compatibility
   - And the user receives clear feedback about device status (working/failed)
   - And audio engine configuration is updated to use the new device
   - And settings are automatically saved with the new device preference

3. **Audio Parameter Configuration** - Allow configuration of sample rate and buffer size with device-specific constraints
   - Given the user wants to optimize audio performance
   - When the user accesses audio device settings
   - Then sample rate options are available (22050, 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000, 192000 Hz)
   - And buffer size options are available as powers of 2 (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 samples)
   - And the UI shows which combinations are supported by the selected device
   - And changes are applied immediately with validation and user feedback

4. **Device Monitoring and Error Handling** - Handle device disconnection and errors gracefully
   - Given an audio device is in use
   - When the device becomes unavailable (unplugged, driver issues, etc.)
   - Then the application detects the device loss
   - And automatically falls back to the default device
   - And the user is notified of the device change with a clear message
   - And the settings are updated to reflect the fallback device

5. **Audio Engine Integration** - Seamless integration with existing AudioEngine architecture
   - Given device or parameter changes are made
   - When the user applies new audio settings
   - Then the AudioEngine is properly updated without disrupting ongoing audio processing
   - And the new settings are validated against AudioEngine constraints
   - And master volume and other audio settings are preserved during device changes
   - And the Arc<Mutex<T>> thread safety patterns are maintained

## Dev Notes

### Current Architecture Context [Source: src/audio/engine.rs and src/settings.rs]

**Existing AudioEngine Architecture**:
- AudioEngine already has `get_available_devices()` method that returns `Vec<String>` of device names
- Device selection logic exists in `new_with_settings()` method with fallback to default device
- Current implementation includes basic device preference handling via `AudioSettings.preferred_device`
- Thread-safe communication using Arc<Mutex<T>> patterns between audio and UI threads
- Audio processing must remain real-time safe (no allocations in audio callback)

**Current Settings Infrastructure**:
- AudioSettings struct already exists with sample_rate, buffer_size, master_volume, preferred_device fields
- Settings validation is implemented with appropriate ranges for audio parameters
- Auto-save functionality exists for immediate settings application
- Settings dialog exists at `src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs` with audio section

### Previous Story Insights [Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]

**Key learnings from Settings Infrastructure (Story 2.1)**:
- Settings persistence works correctly with JSON and cross-platform config directories
- AudioEngine integration is functional with settings-based initialization
- Settings dialog provides immediate apply functionality with categorized tabs
- Validation patterns are established for audio parameters
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations (WASM vs native) are handled

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Device Enumeration Enhancement**:
```rust
// Enhanced device information structure
pub struct AudioDeviceInfo {
    pub name: String,
    pub id: String,  // Platform-specific device identifier
    pub is_default: bool,
    pub is_available: bool,
    pub supported_sample_rates: Vec<u32>,
    pub supported_buffer_sizes: Vec<u32>,
}

// Enhanced AudioEngine methods needed
impl AudioEngine {
    pub fn get_available_devices_detailed() -> Result<Vec<AudioDeviceInfo>>;
    pub fn refresh_devices() -> Result<Vec<AudioDeviceInfo>>;
    pub fn test_device_configuration(device_name: &str, sample_rate: u32, buffer_size: u32) -> Result<bool>;
    pub fn monitor_device_availability(&self) -> Result<bool>;
}
```

**Settings Dialog Enhancements** [Source: src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs]:
- Add device refresh button to audio settings section
- Implement device dropdown with status indicators
- Add sample rate/buffer size dropdowns with device compatibility filtering
- Integrate device testing feedback into the UI
- Add device monitoring status display

**AudioSettings Structure Updates**:
```rust
// Additional fields needed in AudioSettings
pub struct AudioSettings {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub device_monitoring_enabled: bool,
    pub auto_fallback_enabled: bool,
    pub last_known_good_device: Option<String>,
}
```

### File Locations for New Code [Source: project structure analysis]

**Primary Implementation Files**:
- **AudioEngine Enhancement**: `src/audio/engine.rs` - Device enumeration, testing, monitoring
- **Settings Dialog Update**: `src/ui/components/settings_dialog.rs` - UI for device configuration
- **Settings Structure**: `src/settings.rs` - AudioSettings enhancements for monitoring

**Integration Points**:
- `src/ui/app.rs` - Device change notifications and UI updates
- `src/audio/mod.rs` - Module exports for new device functionality

### Threading and Safety Considerations [Source: CLAUDE.md architecture]

**Thread Safety Requirements**:
- Device enumeration and testing must be performed off audio thread
- Device switching requires careful coordination with existing audio stream
- Settings changes should not block audio processing
- Device monitoring should use separate thread or polling mechanism

**Audio Engine Integration Strategy**:
- Device changes may require audio stream restart
- Preserve existing Arc<Mutex<T>> patterns for thread-safe access
- Maintain master volume and other settings during device transitions
- Ensure real-time audio callback remains allocation-free

### CPAL Integration Requirements [Source: src/audio/engine.rs analysis]

**Device Enumeration with CPAL**:
- Use `host.output_devices()` for device enumeration
- Query device capabilities via `device.default_output_config()` and `device.supported_output_configs()`
- Handle device configuration testing via temporary stream creation
- Implement device availability checking via device re-enumeration

**Device Configuration Patterns**:
- Follow existing CPAL StreamConfig pattern for device testing
- Use device.name() for user-friendly device identification
- Handle different sample formats (F32, I16, U16) per existing patterns
- Maintain existing error handling patterns for device failures

### WebAssembly Compatibility [Source: CLAUDE.md and src/settings.rs]

**Dual Compilation Considerations**:
- Device enumeration may have different behavior in WASM builds
- Web Audio API constraints for browser-based device access
- Settings persistence differences between native and WASM builds
- Use `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` for web-specific device behavior

## Testing

### Testing Framework [Source: existing test patterns in engine.rs]
- Use existing Rust unit testing framework (`#[cfg(test)]` modules)
- Follow existing test patterns for AudioEngine and settings components
- Focus on device enumeration, configuration, and monitoring behavior
- Create mock device scenarios for testing fallback behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Device enumeration should not block UI or audio processing
- Device monitoring should have minimal performance impact
- Device configuration changes should be efficient and non-disruptive
- Settings UI should remain responsive during device operations
